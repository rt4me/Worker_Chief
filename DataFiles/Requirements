    Read registration file and create a list of dictionaries containing information for each participant based on the downloaded Worker Worksheet from MSR Reports
    Use API to pull registration information
        Get Event ID by doing a GET on the MSR API, providing the event number and the year of the event
        Use Event ID to pull registration information
